## Working with the product
### Unity base
The base code of the product can be found as /InteractiveAvatar as a project to import and work on with Unity. We suggest using Rider for working on the included code. Rider can automatically link code changes with Unity. Note that Unity should be set to use WebGL as intended platform for building the project.
### Phoneme Server
The implemented nodejs express phoneme server used for transcribing text to phonemes can be found as /website/backend
### React Web App
Example code for a stylish react web application that uses the product can be found as /website/client
### Simple Web page
Example code for a simple web page that uses the product with demo functions can be found as /InteractiveAvatar/Assets/WebGLTemplates/Interactive. Unity uses this as a template when Building the project, filling in the marked sections to produce a web page such as the one included as /website/client/unity.

## Live demonstration pages
A live version of the react web application can be viewed at : http://talkingcoach.ewi.tudelft.nl/

A live version of the simple web page with demo functions can be viewed at : http://ii.tudelft.nl/epva34/

## Server Setup
A zip file with all the required components to set up a server for this product has been included as talkingcoach_server_setup.zip.

It includes a readme that describes the general structure / installation of the server, and a full install guide with included installation script for linux.

## Large File Support
This repository makes use of git Large File Storage due to GitHub's 100MB file size limit.

currently the only file tracked by git lfs is InteractiveAvatar/Assets/Animations/walk_into_screen.anim at 134MB
recommended to avoid git lfs as much as possible as it is very slow.

for information on how to use git lfs:
see https://git-lfs.github.com/
and https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Tutorial#migrating-existing-repository-data-to-lfs

the original repo was converted to lfs using the following tool : https://github.com/bozaro/git-lfs-migrate
