This repository contains the combined work of EPVA3 and EPVA4's context projects for the TUDelft. 
The product is an extension of the original TalkingCoach project (https://github.com/ruuddejong/TalkingCoach).

EPVA3 has added body animation based on emotion.
EPVA4 has added mouth animation based on speech.
